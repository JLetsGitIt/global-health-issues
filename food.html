 <b>Statistics</b><br>
 The number of hungry people in the world has increased over the last few years. One in nine people in
 the world go hungry each day and suffer from nutritional deficiencies as a result.
 In previous years, food security has been the biggest threat to the overall health of the human
 population, more so than malaria, tuberculosis or HIV. And, 2020 saw the most severe increase in
 global food insecurity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting vulnerable households almost 
 everywhere.
 Current estimates show that nearly 690 million people are going hungry ‚Äì up by 10 million people in 
 just one year and by nearly 60 million in five years.

<p style="padding-left: 270px;"><b>What is the problem?</b><br>
 The problem is not that we aren‚Äôt producing enough food, but rather that people lack access to food.
 Many people do not have enough money to purchase food and cannot grow their own.
 Nutritious food is often more expensive and, in some areas, access to healthy foods is restricted or
 even non-existent. When food prices rise, lower-income communities have no choice but to choose
 prepackaged, high-carb and high-sugar options.

 <b>Effects of Food Insecurity</b><br>
 In response to chronic hunger and malnutrition, humans decrease in body size, known in 
 medical terms as stunting or stunted growth. Once stunting has occurred, the individual 
 may experience a failure of vital organs, a higher rate of disease and illness, and even 
 defects in cognitive development. In addition, several studies have shown that food 
 insecurity is strongly associated with a higher risk of depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders.
