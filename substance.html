 <b>Statistics</b><br>
 As defined by the World Health Organization, substance abuse is ‚Äúthe harmful or hazardous 
 use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol and illicit drugs‚Äù. Substance abuse 
 is responsible for the death of millions of people worldwide each year.
 Around 269 million people used drugs worldwide in 2018, which is 30 per cent more than in 2009,
 while over 35 million people suffer from drug use disorders. Rising unemployment and reduced 
 opportunities caused by the pandemic are also likely to disproportionately affect the poorest,
 making them more vulnerable to drug use and also to drug trafficking and cultivation in order 
 to earn money.

<p style="padding-left: 270px"><b>Prevention & Treatment</b><br>
 Prevention and treatment continue to fall short in many parts of the world, with only one 
 in seven people with drug use disorders receiving treatment each year.
 The Report shows that effective treatment interventions based on scientific evidence and 
 in line with international human rights obligations are not as available or accessible as 
 they need to be, and national governments and the international community need to step up
 interventions in order to address this gap.

 <b>Trends in Drug Use</b><br>
 Cannabis was the most used substance worldwide in 2018, with an estimated 192 million people 
 using it worldwide. Opioids, however, remain the most harmful, as over the past decade, 
 the total number of deaths due to opioid use disorders went up 71 per cent, with a 92 per cent
 increase among women compared with 63 per cent among men.
 Vulnerable and marginalized groups, youth, women and the poor are most affected by the world 
 drug problem. In addition, Drug use increased far more rapidly among developing countries over 
 the 2000-2018 period than in developed countries. Adolescents and young adults also account for 
 the largest share of those using drugs.
