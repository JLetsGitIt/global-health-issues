 <b>What is mental health?</b><br>
 Mental health refers to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being. It is all about how
 people think, feel, and behave. Mental health can affect daily living, relationships, and 
 physical health, as conditions such as stress, depression, and anxiety can be very disruptive.
 Continuous social and economic pressure as well as biological factors are risk factors for 
 mental health conditions.

 been negatively impacted due to worry and stress over the coronavirus. A recent review of 
 health care professionals found a 23% prevalence of depression and anxiety, and 39% 
 prevalence of insomnia during COVID-19.
