 <b>What is this website about?</b><br>
 2020 was a devastating year for global health. A previously unknown virus spread across 
 the world, rapidly emerging as one of its top killers, laying bare the inadequacies of 
 our current health systems. <br>
 To help raise awareness about the major health issues that millions around the world are 
 currently suffering from, this website has been designed to keep people informed, 
 prepared, and ready to help us out in our mission to keep everyone healthy!

<p><b>How to navigate the website?</b><br>
 Right now, you are on the homepage. On the side menu, there is a list of some of today's 
 major global health issues. Each item in the list is a clickable link that leads to 
 another website with information on the selected issue. At the top of the screen, there 
 are 3 more links, one to return to the homepage, one to information about how to join the
 cause in solving global health issues, and one to even more resources. <br>
